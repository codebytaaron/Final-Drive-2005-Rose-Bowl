# Final Drive

**Final Drive** is a simple C++ console game inspired by the final drive of the **Texas vs USC 2005 Rose Bowl**. You play as the quarterback on the last possession, making quick decisions with the game on the line.

The game is a simplified, fictionalized run-off of that moment and is not a recreation of the real game.
